Boro was born in 1928 in Istanbul and developed a passion for sailing at an early age. He studied engineering in Germany and worked as a journalist and photographer for various magazines. He met his wife Oda, a German nurse, in 1952 and they married in 1954. They bought their first yacht, a 10-meter wooden sloop named KÄ±smet, and sailed around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea for several years.
 
In 1965, they decided to embark on a bigger challenge: to sail around the world with their new yacht, Vira Demir, a 12-meter steel ketch. They left Istanbul on June 15, 1965 and headed westward, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the Panama Canal, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal, and the Mediterranean Sea. They faced many difficulties and dangers along the way, such as storms, pirates, sharks, coral reefs, and bureaucratic obstacles. They also encountered many cultures and peoples, making friends and learning from their experiences.
 
They returned to Istanbul on June 15, 1968, after exactly three years of sailing. They were greeted by thousands of people who celebrated their achievement and welcomed them home. Boro wrote his book *Vira Demir* based on his notes and photographs from the voyage. The book was published in 1970 and became a bestseller in Turkey. It was also translated into English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Arabic, Persian, and Japanese.
 
Boro continued to sail and write until his death in 2015 at the age of 87. He was awarded many honors and medals for his contributions to sailing, literature, and environmentalism. He was also an advocate for marine conservation and education. He founded the Turkish Marine Environment Protection Association (TURMEPA) in 1994 and donated his yacht Vira Demir to the Istanbul Technical University for research purposes.
 
Sadun Boro was a pioneer and an inspiration for many sailors and adventurers who followed his footsteps. He left behind a legacy of courage, curiosity, and love for the sea.
  
After their circumnavigation, Boro and Oda settled in Marmaris, a coastal town in southwestern Turkey. They built a house on a hill overlooking the bay and named it Vira Demir Evi (Vira Demir House). They continued to sail around the Turkish coast and the Aegean Sea, exploring new places and revisiting old ones. They also hosted many guests and friends who came to visit them and share their stories.
 
Boro also wrote several more books about his sailing adventures, such as *KÄ±smet*, *Denizciler Geliyor*, *Yelkenliyle Atlantik'i AÅmak*, and *Denizlerin Ãtesinde*. He also wrote articles and columns for various newspapers and magazines, such as *HÃ¼rriyet*, *Cumhuriyet*, *Milliyet*, and *Yelken*. He was a respected and influential figure in the Turkish sailing community and beyond.
 
Boro was also passionate about protecting the marine environment and raising awareness about the threats facing the oceans. He witnessed firsthand the effects of pollution, overfishing, climate change, and human interference on the marine ecosystems. He founded TURMEPA in 1994 with the aim of educating the public and promoting sustainable practices for the preservation of the seas. He also donated his yacht Vira Demir to the Istanbul Technical University in 2004, where it was used for scientific research and education.
 
Boro died on June 5, 2015 in Marmaris after a long illness. He was buried at sea with his wife Oda, who had passed away in 2009. They were both cremated and their ashes were scattered in the waters they loved so much. Their house Vira Demir Evi was turned into a museum and a memorial site for their fans and admirers.
